Q1 How do we run the code in out project

go run nameoffile
 
 1. go build -> compiles the source code and 
 doesn't execute it we will get main file 
 we can execute it by ./main

 2. go run -> Compiles and executes one or two files
 3. go fmt -> Formats all code in each file in current dir
 4. go install -> compiles and installs a package
 5. go get -> downloads the raw source code of someone else package
 6. go test -> Runs any test associated iwth the project


Q2 What does 'package main' mean

package == project = common source code

Two packages -> Executable (Runs the code does something)
Reusable -> Helper the code is like dependencies but they 
are not run  

package main = executable package
package blahblah = will not spit out any runnable file
If a package is main then it should have a main function

Q3 fmt

we can import fmt or calculator which is useful for functions
Standard library of go is fmt

Q4 func() thing

func nameofFunction(){

}

The curly braces should be declared beside func

Q5 How is main structures
package 
import
then func
